### Data Engineering projects

At the moment of writing, I am preparing to develop a data pipeline. This would be my first step toward Data Engineering and it would be stored here in GitHub.
I plan to use Python to access SEC's API (EDGAR), and leverage free tools such as Google Colab, BigQuery, etc.(more tools added as needed).

I would also be stepping up my networking, setting up potential information interviews, etc. That area needs the most effort at the moment
